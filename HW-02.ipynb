During the lectures, you have seen (or soon will see) how maximizing user engagement and click-rate is of great importance and a main objective for such businesses.  \n",

    "### Understanding the Problem\n",
    "As stated above, Upworthy is, in essence, a content creation and news delivery business. The process of creating a news-related post starts from the raw material and then proceeds to processing the information and presenting it in a way that engages the users, i.e. having them interact with the website, as much as possible.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We have discussed main objectives and income sources of various businesses and how data science can affect that. You must know that the main source of revenue and consequently the most important goal of Upworthy, is to get the most views and clicks per piece of news.  \n",
    "\n",
    "A typical form of presentation for news websites is to first show the user a headline together with a thumbnail and sometimes an excerpt (or **lede** as defined later). But it is a well-known fact that not all the headlines attract users the same.  \n",
    "\n",
    "There are always several possible headlines that can be used for a piece of news. Nonetheless, just one can be used for presenting each content and we know that there is no scientific or formulaic approach to predict which one will actually be the most interesting for the users.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Here is where you data scientists are brought into field!**  \n",
    "The problem is simply to find which headline should be chosen for any individual post to maximize the website's profit. What solutions come to your mind? Can you think of a novel formula to mathematically calculate an indicator of the headlines attractiveness? What about its engaging rate?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Discuss\n",
    "What possible solutions can you think of for this problem? Can you solve it mathematically? If so explain your solution, and if not, explain why do you think it's not feasible?"

    "We adopt an A/B testing methodology where users are randomly assigned different headlines, and their engagement and time spent on the website are monitored. This approach bears resemblance to the $\\epsilon$-greedy strategy employed in multi-armed bandit scenarios within Reinforcement Learning, where $\\epsilon$ assumes values like 0.1 or 0.01. The headline generating higher engagement yields greater rewards, shifting the probability for a random user to view that headline towards certainty (1-$\\epsilon$), while other headlines reduce to a probability of $\\epsilon$. Consequently, if an alternative headline outperforms the current champion, it supersedes as the primary headline."

    "A/B tests are experiments that compare two scenarios (e.g., scenario A vs. scenario B). \n",
    "They test subjects' responses to each of the variants to determine which is more effective ([read more about A/B tests on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A/B_testing)).  \n",
    "A/B tests allow us to draw conclusions about the different scenarios by randomizing exposure to them, e.g., one could flip a coin and assign a user to scenario A if it lands heads and to B if it lands tails.  \n",
    "Since exposure is randomized, we can be confident that the scenarios are the sole explanation for statistically significant differences in subjects' responses (if they exist).  \n",
    "In theory, A/B testing refers to an experiment that compares two scenarios; however, in practice, the term is also used when we compare multiple scenarios (e.g., A vs. B vs. C), although the more precise terminology would be to call such an experiment a \"multinomial test.\""

    "### **How were A/B tests used by Upworthy?** \n",
    "Upworthy used A/B testing to increase news readership, conducting experiments for each published news piece.  \n",
    "In each experiment, they created multiple \"packages\" of stimuli, varying headlines, images, excerpts, and **ledes** for the same news piece.  \n",
    "Different \"packages\" were shown on their (now defunct) website to engage users with the news pieces they produced. Upworthy found \"the best\" package by conducting A/B tests, showing different packages to different users, and measuring how often users clicked on each version.  \n",
    "Below, we show three \"packages\" used by Upworthy in an experiment, each with a different headline for the same news piece.  \n",
    "Upworthy randomized users that visited their website saw one of the three versions of the headline below. Then, they measured the percentage of times users in each scenario clicked to read the news.  \n",
